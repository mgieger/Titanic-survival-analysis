# Titanic Dataset Analysis

An analysis of the Kaggle dataset "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

This repo uses three different Machine Learning models to analyze the Titanic dataset. Each model uses the same preprocessor to shape the data prior to analysis, and uses the same training and testing dataset csvs.

## Models Used

* Neural Networks (1, 2, and 3) layers deep
* Kernel-SVM
* Random Forest using Ensemble learning
